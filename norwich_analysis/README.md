# 🧠 Norwich Analysis

An ongoing collection of data-driven Noriwch analysis projects exploring performance trends and team modelling. This work blends expected goals (xG), rolling trends, radar plots, and match simulations using Python and Matplotlib.

## 📂 Projects Included

### ⚽ 1. **Norwich City – xPts Simulation & Rolling xG Analysis**
- Simulates **expected points (xPts)** for each match using a **shot-by-shot Monte Carlo model**
- Compares xPts to actual points earned to assess **over- or under-performance**
- Plots **rolling xG averages** (xGF and xGA) with contextual annotations (e.g., injuries, suspensions)
- Tools: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`

> 📊 *Insight: Norwich began the season creating plenty of chances but leaking goals. Mid-season, attacking output dropped with a tightening of defensive structure — likely due to key attacking absences.*
> - *Full post season analysis coming soon with Medium article*

### 🎯 2. **Ante Crnac – Shot Profile & Comparative Analysis**
- Compares his output to **other Championship forwards in his age bracket**
- - Considering his lack of experience in the championship and periods in and out of the team, he has strong goal scoring and npxG/90 numbers.
- - At the time of writing he is joint top scorer among those U22 (7 goals) despite taking 1.25 fewer shots per 90 than joint top (U22) scorer Mayenda.
- - Only 3 have a better npxG/shot ratio. With a more solidifed role/position within the squad, he has shown promise of an impressive output next season.

### 🕸️ 3. **Player Radars – Performance Archetypes**
- Builds radar charts for selected players using key metrics
- - Comparison of Sargent and Sainz this season against last season.
  - Sainz has built on a promising 2023/24 season with an immense goal scoring season.
  - Sargent has supplemented his scoring output with some top creative output, perhaps facilitating the increase in performance of Sainz this season.

## 📦 Tools & Libraries Used
- `pandas` / `numpy` — data wrangling and modeling
- `matplotlib` — static visuals and custom plots
- `scipy` — smoothing (Savitzky-Golay)
- `PIL` — for badge/logo integration
- Git for version control
